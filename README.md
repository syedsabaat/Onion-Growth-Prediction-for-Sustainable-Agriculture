# Onion Growth Prediction for Sustainable Agriculture

## Description
This repository contains a project using Linear Regression and XGBoost to predict onion crop yields based on historical weather data. The goal is to assist farmers in optimizing harvest efficiency and addressing global food and water scarcity.

## Objectives
- Predict onion crop yield for a given location using historical weather data.
- Assist farmers in maximizing efficiency and output of onion harvests.
- Address global issues of hunger and water scarcity by optimizing resource use.

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing from FAOSTAT and VisualCrossing.
- Feature extraction and analysis of key weather variables impacting onion yield.
- Implementation of Linear Regression and XGBoost models.
- Analysis of the impact of individual and combined weather conditions on crop yield.

## Methodology
- Collected and preprocessed historical crop yield and weather data.
- Analyzed the influence of temperature, dew, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover on onion yield.
- Applied XGBoost regressor to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
- Identified significant weather factors and their combined effect on crop yield.

## Findings
- Temperature and dew had the most significant impact on onion yield.
- The combined effect of weather conditions showed a strong correlation with an RÂ² value of 0.63.
- Highlighted the complexity and non-linearity of weather-crop relationships.

## Future Work
- Expand the model to predict yields for other crops.
- Implement the model in real-time agricultural decision support systems.
- Explore commercial and educational applications to benefit farmers and agronomists.
